### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh, where I predominantly focused on theoretical aspects of the field. Currently open to try out different projects and meet with different technologies as I want to explore this beautiful field a bit more before I embark on future studies!

Previously, I built assistive Bots for traders at JP Morgan, and automated text-classifications for energy trading firm Gen-I.
